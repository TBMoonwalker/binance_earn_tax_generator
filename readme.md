# Binance Earn Products Tax Generator  
## Overview
This little python program extracts all interests from the Binance Earn Flexible and Locked Products through the Binance savings api and generates a tax file for further use.

**Please be aware that errors can happen. Please cross check the list with your own calculations!**

**This tool is not a tax software and I'm not responsible for wrong calculations.**

**This tool is intended only as support for your own tax calculations!**

## How to use
There is an `config.ini.example` file in the repository. Please rename it to `config.ini`

The attributes should be self-explanatory. If not, please create an Issue and I will adapt this readme.

After configuration just please run `pip install requirements.txt` 

If the installation of the Python requirements was successfull you can run `python savings.py` and should see a `tax.csv` in your directory afterwards.
